- There are **13 Nodes/Points/Places** in this scenario. The **numerical value** within the nodes indicates the cost of travelling between the nodes. The **dual arrow** indicates the possibility of travelling in both ways. 
- There are 3 restaurants which have been indicated by **Restaurant 1, Restaurant 2, Restaurant 3.**

| Restaurants | Position |
| ------ | ------ |
| Restaurant 1  | Node 3 |
| Restaurant 2  | Node 6 |
| Restaurant 3 | Node 13 |

- There are 5 customers which have been indicated by **Customer  1, Customer 2, Customer 3, Customer  4, Customer 5.**

| Customers | Position |
| ------ | ------ |
| Customer 1  | Node 1 |
| Customer 2  | Node 5 |
| Customer 3  | Node 7 |
| Customer 4  | Node 10 |
| Customer 5  | Node 12 |

- There are **2 types** of transportation system. They are **Bikes** and **BiCycles**. These are used to deliver the food to the customers. Bicycles are more cost efficient than bikes.

| Transportation | Initial Position | Per KM Cost |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Bike 1  | Node 2 | 4 |
| Bicycle 1  | Node 8 | 2.5 |

## Project Goal
The goal of the project is 
- To deliver food to all the customers
- To make the delivery process cost efficient

## Project Future Opportunities
Considering the higher demand of the food delivery system, many constraints can be added to this project. 
 
- Delivery Time Constraints
- Balance in Cost and Time Minimization
- Multiple order at once from a single customer
- Prioritizing the orders
- Allowing the food delivery person a commission based  on the order value
